libcaca.js

A toy project to learn howto port a simple library to emscripten and not 
die trying.

There is two ways of using libcaca.js

** img2txt.js

This is the command line tool to convert a image to ascii art, since this
is not compiled agains imlib2, the input format must be a bmp hopefully 
we can use canvas2image.js (http://www.nihilogic.dk/labs/canvas2image/) 
to transform a canvas into a bmp. A slighty modifications are need into
canvas2image to get the raw data instead of base64 uri.

** libcaca.js

Exporting the library itsef and calling the low level function on javascript,
it's much more efficient

Take a look to the demo page :) and to the post http://coscolla.net/?p=236

Instructions to get emscriptten working on macosx

1) Download emscripten from https://github.com/kripken/emscripten/wiki/Emscripten-SDK
2) ./emsdk update
3) ./emsdk install latest
4) ./emsdk activate latest
5) export PATH=$PATH:$(WHAT_SAYS_IN_THE_ACTIVATE_STATE)

now you must have emcc, emconfigure and emmake in your path  

Remember to do a git submodule init; git submodule update to download the libcaca submodule, and 
last step simply is execute the scripts to compile :D
